# Sweetiebot Data Folder

This is where the files that Sweetiebot uses will go, excluding the database.

**selfhost.json** is a file containing Sweetie's token, main guild ID, and your database authentication.

**[GuildID].json** is your server config file, containing various settings and quotes. The database is still required for bucket items, chatlog search, userinfo, and other features.
