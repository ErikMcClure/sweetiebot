Pinkie Pie: Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate.
Rarity: Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
Pinkie Pie: What's Twilight doing?
Spike: She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.
Rarity: Where are the others? It's getting late.
Applejack: Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
Twilight Sparkle: Perfect! I'm ready.
Rainbow Dash: For what?
Twilight Sparkle: All right, Spike.
Pinkie Pie: An apple! Are we having pie?
Spike: Shh! Watch!
[collective: Awesome! Wow! Lovely!]
Twilight Sparkle: Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
Fluttershy: Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: You have my word.
Twilight Sparkle: Ta-da!
[collective: Oh. Uh. Ah. That's a choice. Interesting.]
Twilight Sparkle: Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight.
Fluttershy: Opalescence, no!
["mouse-horses" neighing]
Twilight Sparkle: Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
Rarity: What ever shall we do?
Rarity: Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?

Twilight Sparkle: Oh. Yeah. Right.

[theme song]

Pinkie Pie: Ooh!
Spike: Come on, you guys. Let me in!
Rainbow Dash: Sure thing, Spike.
Rarity: Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
Applejack: Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.
Rarity: [moan] I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.
Spike: I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our home town, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!
Rainbow Dash: Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
Rarity: We'll just have to see.
Applejack: We're gonna be a mite busy.
Pinkie Pie: Busy having fun! [boing]
Spike: Oh. Okay.
Twilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.
Spike: Great!

Spike: 'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.
[excited chatter inside carriage]
Spike: Then let's get moving! Hyah!
Caramel: Excuse me!?
Spike: Um... I...
Lucky Clover: If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Hmph.

Spike: Whoa! You all look... amazing!

Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.
Princess Celestia: Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together.
Twilight Sparkle: That's just what I was hoping you'd say.

Rarity: [gasp] [squeals of excitement] Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... WAIT! Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined! Even better than I imagined.

[bird chirping]
Fluttershy: Oh my! A meadowlark!
[whistling]
Fluttershy: I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for! [humming]
[whistling]

Applejack: Howdy, partner! You hungry?
Soarin: As a horse!
Applejack: Well, what'cha hankering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?
Soarin: I'll take that big apple pie!
Applejack: Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yee-haw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.

Spitfire: Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin?
Soarin: Heh. Yeah! [gasp] My pie! You saved it. Thanks.
Rainbow Dash: Hey, no prob.
Spitfire: Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale and won The Best Flyer Competition.
Rainbow Dash: Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
Spitfire: Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, well, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.
Soarin: [OMNOM] Yeah... [NOMNOMNOM...]
Spitfire: Wanna come hang out with us?

I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
It's all I ever dreamed.

It's all I ever dreamed, woo hoo!
It's all I ever dreamed, yippee!
I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[pause]

It's all I've ever... dreamed?

Prince Blueblood: Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood.
Rarity: I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
Prince Blueblood: You mean... this rose? Thank you. It goes with my eyes.
Rarity: [moan]

Fluttershy: [humming]
[whistling]
Fluttershy: [gasp] My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
Mr. Greenhooves: [whistling]
Fluttershy: Was that you?
Mr. Greenhooves: Yep! I love whistlin' while I work. [whistles]
Fluttershy: Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
[animal noises]
Fluttershy: Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo? Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.

[ponies chattering]
Rainbow Dash: Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip? [to Soarin] You ever soared past lightning? It's awesome!

Princess Celestia: Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
Twilight Sparkle: Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
Princess Celestia: Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again.
Twilight Sparkle: [sigh] Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.

Applejack: First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales. [sigh] This ain't what I expected at all.

Pinkie Pie: I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.

Rarity: This isn't at all what I imagined.

Princess Celestia: [in background] Good evening! So nice to see you. Welcome!
Twilight Sparkle: This isn't what I hoped.

Rainbow Dash: This isn't hanging out.

Fluttershy: This isn't what I wished for.

Twilight Sparkle: No!
Rarity: I waited all my life...
Fluttershy: ...for this moment!
Pinkie Pie: And I'm not going to...
Applejack: ...let it slip by!
Rainbow Dash: If it's the last thing I do...
Twilight Sparkle: ...I'm gonna make this...
All: ...the best night ever!

Fluttershy: I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says. [loudly] I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
[sound of crunching]
Fluttershy: Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend?
Mr. Greenhooves: Mmm... Sounds good to me.

Rainbow Dash: Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you. [whistles]
"Caesar": [yells] [grunts]

Rarity: Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
Prince Blueblood: Miss Rarity! Stop!
Rarity: Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
Prince Blueblood: One would hate to slip.
Rarity: Yes. One certainly would.
Prince Blueblood: One's cloak should take care of the problem.
Rarity: Oh, of course it will.

Pinkie Pie: [gasp] [whispering]
Pinkie Pie: C'mon, everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!

[Pinkie Pie]
You reach your right hoof in
You reach your right hoof out
You reach your right hoof in
And you shake it all about
You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout
That's what I'm talking about

You step your left hoof in
You pull it right back out
You step your left hoof in
But you better help him out
You do the Pony Pokey but should find a different route
That's what it's all about

You kick your back leg in
You pull your back leg out
You reach your back leg in
Just be brave and have no doubt
You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout
That's what I'm singing about

You tilt your head in
You tilt your head out
You tilt your head in
Then you shake it all about
You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout
You're better off without

You stomp your whole self in
You stomp your whole self out
You stomp your whole self in
And you stomp yourself about
You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout-

Fluttershy: COME OUT!

[Pinkie Pie]
That's what I'm talking about

You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey
And that's what it's all about

Yeah!
Lyrica Lilac: Young lady, this is not that kind of party.
Pinkie Pie: Ohhhhhh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay!

Rarity: Two apple fritters, please.
Applejack: Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.
Rarity: Ahem.
Prince Blueblood: Ahem.
Rarity: Ahem!
Prince Blueblood: AHEM!
Rarity: [sigh] I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
Applejack: It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered.
Rarity: Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.
Prince Blueblood: [barf] Oh! Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples! My royal lips have touched common carnival fare! I'm going to the buffet for some... hors d'oeuvres.
Applejack: Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.

Fluttershy: I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be MINE! MINE!!! [evil laugh] Whoa!

Pinkie Pie: Come on, everypony! You wanted a partay? Now it's paaartaaay! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo!
Applejack: Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
Pinkie Pie: STAGE DIVE!
Rarity and Prince Blueblood: [scream]
Rarity: [angry growl] You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! In fact, the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!
Prince Blueblood: Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!
Rarity: Afraid to get dirty?! [babbles]
Prince Blueblood: [whimpering]
Rainbow Dash: This is my chance! Yes! Whoa!
[crash]
Twilight Sparkle: Well... it can't get any worse.
[rumbling]
[door opens]
[animals chattering]
Fluttershy: You're... going to LOVE ME!
[ponies screaming]
Twilight Sparkle: Um, um, uh... Eugh.
Princess Celestia: Run.
Twilight Sparkle: [whistles]

Pinkie Pie: Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you.
Rarity: [shriek] No! Ugh! Let's go!

Spike: Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.
Joe: Don't you think you've had enough?
Spike: Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
[bell rings]
Joe: Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha. Long time no see.
Spike: Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever?

Spike: That sounds like the worst night ever!
Everypony: It was! [laughter]
Twilight Sparkle: I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala.
Princess Celestia: That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
Everypony: Princess Celestia!
Twilight Sparkle: Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.
Princess Celestia: Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.
Twilight Sparkle: It is?
Princess Celestia: That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.
Twilight Sparkle: You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.
Rainbow Dash: Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
Fluttershy: Talking!
Pinkie Pie: Laughing!
Spike: You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
Twilight Sparkle: Yes, Spike. You were right.
Applejack: As horrible as our night was...
Rarity: ...being together here has made it all better.
Pinkie Pie: In fact, it's made it...
All (except Celestia): ...the best night ever! [laughter]
