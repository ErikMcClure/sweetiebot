Fluttershy: La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
Parasprite: [chirp]
Fluttershy: Gah!
Parasprite: [chirp]
Fluttershy: Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
Parasprite: [sniff]
Fluttershy: Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you were hungry.
Parasprite: [purr]
Fluttershy: You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.

[theme song]

Twilight Sparkle: Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.
Spike: It also didn't mess itself up.
Twilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
Spike: I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
Twilight Sparkle: There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.
Spike: Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw.
Twilight Sparkle: Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
Spike: You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
Twilight Sparkle: Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
Spike: Or maybe I should... [groan]

[ponies chatter]
Twilight Sparkle: What happened to the rest of her name?
Golden Harvest: We couldn't fit it all in.
Twilight Sparkle: You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again.

Twilight Sparkle: That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.

Twilight Sparkle: Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?
Mrs. Cake: Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
Pinkie Pie: Mmm... [slurp]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
Pinkie Pie: I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
Fluttershy: Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
Pinkie Pie: No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy?
Fluttershy: You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
Parasprite: [purr] [chirp]
Fluttershy: [gasp] Three?
Twilight Sparkle: They're amazing. What are they?
Fluttershy: I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
Twilight Sparkle: I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
Fluttershy: Pinkie, do you want the other one?
Pinkie Pie: Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
Fluttershy: Ugh?
Twilight Sparkle: A para-what?
Fluttershy: How could you not like...
Pinkie Pie: Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone.
Twilight Sparkle: A what?
Pinkie Pie: A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]
Twilight Sparkle: Ahhh, typical Pinkie.
Parasprite: [purr]

Rarity: Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash: Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me.
Rarity: Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
Twilight Sparkle: Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
Rarity: Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
Rainbow Dash: Ugh, sooo boooring.
Parasprites: [chirp]
Rarity: Huh?
Rainbow Dash: What's that sound, Twilight?
Parasprite: [several chirps]
Rainbow Dash: Wow, what are they?
Twilight Sparkle: The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
Rainbow Dash: Uh, I'll take one.
Rarity: Me too, oh, they're perfect.
Pinkie Pie: Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [baby noises]
Pinkie Pie: Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.

Twilight Sparkle: [sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
Spike: [snore]
Parasprite: [baby noises]
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about?

Parasprites: [loud baby noises]
Twilight Sparkle: Spike! Wake up! What happened?
Spike: Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
Parasprite: [chirp]
Twilight Sparkle: Where did they come from?
Spike: I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
Twilight Sparkle: The princess will be here in a few hours.
Spike: Ugh.
Twilight Sparkle: Spike, help me round up these little guys.
Spike: Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around".

Parasprite: [several chirps]
Rainbow Dash: Huh? Huh?! [screech] [grunt] [groan] Get off me! [groan] [grunt] Waaa!

Rarity: Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
Parasprite: [purr] [grunt]
Rarity: Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
Parasprite: [grunt] [pop]
Rarity: [screech]

Pinkie Pie: Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?
Parasprites: [chirping]
Pinkie Pie: [gasp] And not a moment too soon.
Rarity: Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
Pinkie Pie: And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
Rarity: Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.
Pinkie Pie: You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!

Twilight Sparkle: [gasp]
Rarity: [gasp] I see we're having the same problem.
Rainbow Dash: Ditto!
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
Parasprites: [chirp]
Twilight Sparkle: ...or not.

Twilight Sparkle: Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?
Fluttershy: I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
Rainbow Dash: Guh.
Twilight Sparkle: [whine]

Princess Celestia: [scream]

Twilight Sparkle: If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
Parasprite: [hack]
Rarity: Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster.
Applejack: Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!
Fluttershy: What do we do?
Twilight Sparkle: [gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack.
Rainbow Dash: Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
Applejack: [scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
Rainbow Dash: Aye aye.
Applejack: Yeeeeeee-haw!
Parasprite: [screech]
Applejack: Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there.
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie: Twilight, we don't have much time.
Twilight Sparkle: You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
Pinkie Pie: Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
Twilight Sparkle: Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.
Pinkie Pie: [gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!
Rainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
Pinkie Pie: And you are all so stubborn!
Applejack: Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.

Rainbow Dash: All right! [grunt]
Fluttershy: Ouch.
Twilight Sparkle: We did it. Nice work, Applejack.
Applejack: Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
Twilight Sparkle: Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.

Twilight Sparkle: Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
Fluttershy: [gasps]
Twilight Sparkle: Where did they come from?
Fluttershy: Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
Twilight Sparkle: We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
Rainbow Dash: We call in the weather patrol. [grunts]
Rarity: [shriek]
Rainbow Dash: Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
Parasprites: [chirp]
Twilight Sparkle: [grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
Applejack: Looks like our problems are solved.
Pinkie Pie: They will be with these cymbals. [crash] Hey! Give me those back!
Rainbow Dash: Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, what have you done?
Pinkie Pie: I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
Twilight Sparkle: Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
Pinkie Pie: Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
Applejack: Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
Pinkie Pie: Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and listen to me!

Parasprites: [chirps] [munch] [munch]
Pony: [gasp]
Gardening pony: Aah!
Fluttershy: What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
Applejack: [gasp] My apples!
Twilight Sparkle: We've gotta do something. [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
Pinkie Pie: Look, tambourines! If you could all just... [scream] [tambourines shake]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasp]
Parasprite: [chirp]
Twilight Sparkle: [sigh]
Parasprite: [munch]
Rainbow Dash: Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.
Rarity: Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!

Rarity: My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! [shrieks]
Pinkie Pie: I'll save you!
[recorder]
Rarity: [shriek]

Applejack: No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
[parasprites buzzing]
Applejack: Brace yourself, y'all, here they come. [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'.

Spike: Help!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasp] They're eating the words. [grunts]
Spike: Help...

Zecora: Ugh. Have you gone mad?
Twilight Sparkle: Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?
Zecora: Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?
Twilight Sparkle: I don't know! Is it?
Zecora: Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.
Twilight Sparkle: [gulp]

Twilight Sparkle: [grunts] Oh no, here she comes.
[ponies scream]
Daisy: Aaaah, aaaaaaah!
Twilight Sparkle: Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
Rainbow Dash: YAAAA!
Twilight Sparkle: Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!
[polka music]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?

Twilight Sparkle: Look.
Princess Celestia: Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.
Twilight Sparkle: Hello, princess.
Princess Celestia: So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
[crash]
Twilight Sparkle: So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
Princess Celestia: Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable.
Rainbow Dash: They're not that adorable.
Princess Celestia: I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Twilight Sparkle: Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.
Princess Celestia: Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.
Twilight Sparkle: An... infestation?
Princess Celestia: Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.
Twilight Sparkle: Trouble? What trouble?
Princess Celestia: Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
Twilight Sparkle: My... report?
Princess Celestia: Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Twilight Sparkle: Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives...
[cymbals crash]
Twilight Sparkle: Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
Princess Celestia: I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.
Twilight Sparkle: Thank you, princess.
Pinkie Pie: Hey, what happened to the princess?
Twilight Sparkle: Emergency in Fillydelphia.
Rainbow Dash: Some sort of infestation.
Pinkie Pie: Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
Twilight Sparkle: I think the princess can handle it.
Applejack: So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
Pinkie Pie: Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.
Twilight Sparkle: We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
[Rainbow Dash: I'm sorry, Pinkie.] [Rarity: So sorry, Pinkie.] [Fluttershy: Sorry, Pinkie.] [Applejack: Real sorry, Pinkie.]
Twilight Sparkle: You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
Pinkie Pie: Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
Twilight Sparkle: You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.

Twilight Sparkle: ...Or not.
