Apple Bloom: Okay, Crusaders! Back to the business of earnin' our cutie marks! Any suggestions?
Scootaloo: No, we've tried everything!
Sweetie Belle: We've run out of ideas.
Apple Bloom: Are you kiddin' me, Crusaders? We can do better than that!

[Apple Bloom]
We've been searchin' for our cutie marks
For a while now
Tryin' to find out how we fit in

So many ways we've tried before
But we keep on tryin' more

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in

We'll make our mark
One way or another
We'll make our mark
On the day that we discover
The ultimate reward of our cutie marks!
Apple Bloom: Now, that's more like it!
Pipsqueak: Cutie Mark Crusaders! Help!
Apple Bloom: What's wrong, Pipsqueak?
Pipsqueak: I'm running for student pony president, I was hoping you three would be my campaign managers!
Apple Bloom: We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'! What do ya say, Crusaders?
Cutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah! Hoof!

[theme song]

Apple Bloom: [loudly] So, Pip, how would you help the school if you were elected student pony president?
Pipsqueak: Our playground equipment took quite a beating during Twilight's battle with Tirek!
[snap, thump]
Pipsqueak: If I'm voted in as student pony president, I'll go to the school board and right this wrong!
[foals cheering]
Diamond Tiara: Well, I think that's a ridiculous waste of money! It's just like when Twist proposed to repair the window that Discord destroyed! She just wanted to repair it like a plain old schoolhouse window. But you all know voting for me was the best choice because I convinced the school board to give that window visual appeal!
Apple Bloom: 'Course, it doesn't hurt that her mother Spoiled Rich is president of the school board.
Silver Spoon: Exactly! Which is why when Diamond Tiara is voted student pony president, the school will be putting a statue of her in the center of our schoolyard!
Diamond Tiara: [through gritted teeth] Silver Spoon! That was my big announcement for when I won!
Silver Spoon: I was only trying to help.
Diamond Tiara: [through gritted teeth] I don't need that kind of help!
Apple Bloom: Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara?
Scootaloo: Do we really need a big statue of her?
Sweetie Belle: Especially where our playground equipment should be?
[foals shocked whispering]
Pipsqueak: A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground!
Diamond Tiara: A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote for more Diamond Tiara!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
It's time to make a change
This is our chance
Don't be afraid to do what's right
He's it! Vote for Pip!

We got an opportunity
To have fun again
A vote for Pip, and you can join the fight

It's time for a new leader
It's time to make a change
We're here to fight for what we believe
(Vote for Pip!)
It's finally time we beat her
And play a better game
'Cause when we vote together
There's nothing that we can't achieve

[Diamond Tiara]
I don't believe what I am hearing
I'm the only one you should be cheering
Pipsqueak? Try "Pip's weak!" Don't you think?

But a diamond is perfection
It's natural selection
So your vote better be for me, not the weakest link

Apple Bloom: We'll let the votin' decide!

[Diamond Tiara]
Everypony has their little secrets
I know you do
A vote for me will help you keep them safe
Like your creepy super strength!

Or your mane extension
A little thing I won't mention
Or those freakish large teeth in your face!

Apple Bloom: Come on now, ponies! Don't listen to her!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
You've gotta vote for change
It's time for a new leader
End all the tyranny
Vote now and we can beat her

It's now another day
And we believe in what's right

[Foals]
Vote for Pip! Vote for Pip!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Our victory is in sight

Diamond Tiara: Stop! Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!

Pip makes promises he can't keep
But I can do more
You could really use a new bookbag

'Cause I'll make things happen
That none of you here can afford
To do, like, ever!

Wouldn't you like a little something sweet?
Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat
Who says that I can't be nice?

But first there's one thing
An itsy-bitsy little string
And voting for me is the price!

[Silver Spoon]
I've a tiny suggestion
That you should be aware
You could probably win this election
If you show them all you real—

Diamond Tiara: I don't recall asking you to speak!
All: [gasps]
Sweetie Belle: Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak!

[Foals]
Vote!



[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Stand strong and don't be afraid, ponies
Let's free ourselves from the past

[Foals]
For Pip!
Vote!


[Foals]
He's it! Vote for Pip! Vote!



[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
We'll let honor win out against the tyranny
And make a change that will last

[Foals]
For Pip!
Vote!


[Foals]
Vote for Pip!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
It's time for a new leader
It's time to make a change
We're here to fight for what we believe

[Foals]
Vote for Pip!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
It's finally time we beat her
And play a better game
'Cause when we vote together
There's nothing that we can't achieve

[Foals]
Vote for Pip!

Cheerilee: The votes have been counted! The student pony president is... Pipsqueak!
Diamond Tiara: Huh?!
[foals cheering]
Apple Bloom: Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won!
Pipsqueak: I couldn't have won without the hard work of my campaign managers, the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Sweetie Belle: Campaign manager cutie marks!
Diamond Tiara: Guess you're not as good as you thought, blank flanks! In fact, I demand a recount!
Cheerilee: Trust me, Diamond Tiara. Pip won.
Diamond Tiara: I'll be the judge of that, Miss Cheerilee!
[beat]
Diamond Tiara: What?! One vote! Silver Spoon! You didn't vote for me?!
Silver Spoon: No, I didn't.
Diamond Tiara: But you're my best friend!
Silver Spoon: Am I? 'Cause I tried to help by mentioning your 'surprise' statue, and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to speak! You could have actually won this election if you just listened to me. You wanna know how? [whispering] Sorry. I'm not allowed to speak.
Diamond Tiara: [screams in rage]
Silver Spoon: [to Cutie Mark Crusaders and Pipsqueak] What? I don't have to follow her drum any more.
Apple Bloom: I know Diamond Tiara's been pretty awful, but... we should probably make sure she's okay. Just 'cause she's never cared about anypony else's feelings doesn't mean we shouldn't care about hers.

[door opens]
Spoiled Rich: Diamond Tiara! Why are you making that face? That is not the face of a winner.
Diamond Tiara: Because... I didn't win.
Spoiled Rich: What?! You mean I hefted all these party supplies to celebrate nothing?!
[thump]
Diamond Tiara: Sorry mother.
Spoiled Rich: It's bad enough you lost to that transplant from Trottingham, but imagine if you'd lost to one of those blank flanks. As a Rich pony, you must always think of your social standing.
Fancy Pants: Hm.
Spoiled Rich: That starts here in Ponyville and reaches all over Equestria. Don't ever forget that, Diamond Tiara. Ever!

[Diamond Tiara]
If I'm a diamond
Then why do I feel so rough?
I'm as strong as a stone
Even that's not enough

There's something jagged in me
And I've made such mistakes
I thought that diamonds were hard
Though I feel I could break

Would you believe
That I've always wished I could be somepony else?
Yet I can't see
What I need to do to be the pony I want to be

I've been told my whole life
What to do, what to say
Nopony showed me that
There might be some better way

And now I feel like I'm lost
I don't know what to do
The ground is sinking away
I'm about to fall through

Would you believe
That I've always wished I could be somepony else?
Yet I can't see
What I need to do to be the pony I want to be

To be the pony I want to be
Sweetie Belle: Is it weird that I feel bad for her?
Scootaloo: If it is, then... I'm weird, too.
Apple Bloom: She wants to change, but she doesn't know how.
Sweetie Belle: Seems like she could use a friend or two to help her figure it out.

[bell ringing]
[foals chattering]
Apple Bloom: Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up!
Diamond Tiara: What do you three want? To gloat? Rub in my defeat?
Apple Bloom: Actually, we wanted to invite you to our clubhouse to hang out.
Diamond Tiara: Really?
Scootaloo: Yeah, for real!
Diamond Tiara: Well, thanks to you all, I don't have any important class president business to attend to or anything. So I might as well.
Sweetie Belle: That sounds like a yes...

Diamond Tiara: So, do you three just sit around here plotting out different ways to try and get your cutie marks?
Apple Bloom: Actually, yeah.
Diamond Tiara: You three are... really lucky.
Cutie Mark Crusaders: We are?!
Diamond Tiara: Yeah! You get to explore all these options, learning who you really are before you're stuck with something you don't understand.
Apple Bloom: But... you've done that, right?
Diamond Tiara: Yeah, 'cause I have my cutie mark! And I'm not struggling at all to figure out who I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing with this mark that's already on my flank!
Apple Bloom: Uh... are you sure about that?
Diamond Tiara: [scoffs] That's a weird question.
Sweetie Belle: Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday.
Diamond Tiara: Were you trying to get your cutie mark in spying? Is that on your little chart?
Sweetie Belle: No! We were just worried about you when you lost the election, and then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you...
Apple Bloom: We know you wanna change, and we think we can—
Pipsqueak: [muffled] Help!
[door opens]
Pipsqueak: Cutie Mark Crusaders! I was at the school board meeting and they didn't approve my request for the new playground equipment!
Sweetie Belle: Why not?
Pipsqueak: There's no money in the budget! So I checked my Peggy bank to see if I had enough bits, but my little Peggy wasn't nearly full enough!
Sweetie Belle: Don't worry, Pip!
Scootaloo: We'll meet you back at school.
Apple Bloom: And help you find a solution!
Pipsqueak: Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Diamond Tiara: Oh, I already have a solution! Our new student pony president is gonna be kicked out of office, and I'll be reinstated!
Scootaloo: Where's she going?
Apple Bloom: Where do you think?! C'mon! After her!
Sweetie Belle: Wait! I'm coming too!

[Diamond Tiara]
Cutie Mark Crusaders, get out of my way
Those ponies need to know the truth
And they'll hear it from me

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Stop! Diamond Tiara, this is not the way
You know you're better than this hostility

[Diamond Tiara]
You don't even know me at all
Don't understand the meaning of my fall
What my family would think if I ever
Fail at anything

I'm a diamond – that means you'll never break
No matter what be the cost of the path I take
Whatever I have to do to win in the end

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Stop! This is not the answer
Wait! And it's plainly seen
Listen! You can redeem yourself
But by helping others, not by being mean

We know you want friends who admire you
You want to be the star with all the power too
But there's a better way, there's a better wa-a-ay

There's so much more still left to
Learn about yourself
See the light that shines in you
We know you can be somepony else

You can stop right now
And try another start
You'll finally free yourself from the dark
And see the light
And see the light of your cutie mark
Diamond Tiara: Everypony, I have an announcement!

Apple Bloom: Diamond Tiara! Think hard about the choice you're makin' right now!
Scootaloo: You can be a better pony!
[door opens]
Spoiled Rich: Diamond Tiara! I just happened to be here for the school board meeting, and this is what I see when we adjourn? My daughter associating with confused, insignificant lowlifes? Socializing with their kind is not how you move up in Equestria! Come, Diamond Tiara!
Diamond Tiara: No, mother!
Spoiled Rich: Excuse me?!
Diamond Tiara: You've spent your life acting like a high horse and raised me to follow in your hoofprints! At first I thought this was fine, but then I finally realized I wanted something you don't have – friends!
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [gasps]
Foals and Cheerilee: [gasps]
Spoiled Rich: That's enough, Diamond Tiara! Step away from those blank flanks!
Diamond Tiara: These are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they are my friends! You need to stop calling them such mean and hurtful names! They are working harder to get their cutie marks than anypony I've ever seen! And they will get them exactly when they discover their true talent, which I guarantee will be amazing! Now, will you please deliver this to father?
Spoiled Rich: Yes, of course, dear...
Diamond Tiara: I have to thank you, Crusaders. Obviously I've known since I got my cutie mark that my talent is getting other ponies to do what I want. I just asked my father if he could donate the money for the new playground equipment!
[foals chattering]
Diamond Tiara: [to Pipsqueak] I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you? Ha! Well, I think it's all gonna work out just fine, Mister President!

[Diamond Tiara]
We'll build a playground
For all of us to enjoy
So full of games
There's enough for each girl and boy

I want to help and do
Everything that I can
I'm here to show you I changed
Listen up, here's the plan

Bring it in! That's right, keep it coming! Hey there, you with the amazing strength. Can you help them move that merry-go-round across the lawn? Thank you so much! And you with the super teeth, we need you to help with that teeter-totter. You got it! That's the spirit!

There's so much I can do
To help everypony else
I see the light that shines in me
I know I can be my better self

I can free the past
'Cause now the future's bright for me
My cutie mark has set me free
To do what's right and be the pony I want to be

And be the pony I want to be!
Apple Bloom: I've been thinkin', Crusaders. We spend an awful lot of time fussin' and frettin' tryin' to discover our true talent. But when we take a little time off, we end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent!
Sweetie Belle: Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?
Scootaloo: Absolutely! I don't care if I ever get my cutie mark as long as I get to hang out with my best friends.
Apple Bloom: So what do you say, Crusaders? Want to just focus on helpin' others find their cutie marks?
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Yeah!
[magic zaps]
[foals gasping]
Sweetie Belle: What happened?
Apple Bloom: What's goin' on?
Diamond Tiara: It's your cutie marks! They're amazing!
Cutie Mark Crusaders: We all got the same cutie mark! Cutie Mark Crusaders forever!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
We were searching for our cutie marks
For a while there
Trying to find out how we fit in

So many ways we've tried before
But we kept on trying more
'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in

[Scootaloo]
Now we know what it took all along

[Sweetie Belle]
And our journey here is never really done

[Apple Bloom]
For it is more than just a mark
It's a place for us to start

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
An adventure that has only just begun

We'll make our mark
Show the world what we can do
We'll make our mark
Helping fillies to break through
To the ultimate reward of a cutie mark

Pinkie Pie: All right, everypony! Get ready for the biggest cute-ceañera celebration ever!
[ponies cheering]
Applejack: Oh, sugarcube, if Mom and Dad were here, they'd be so proud of ya.
Apple Bloom: Oh... Thanks, Applejack.
Applejack: Now go on and party with your pals.

[Rainbow Dash]
I'm so proud of you, little buddy
You've taught me a thing or two

[Rarity]
You've inspired everypony around you
And you've inspired me too

[Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack]
You've made your mark
Done Equestria so proud
You've made your mark
And we're here to sing it loud
For the ultimate reward of your cutie mark

Apple Bloom: Well, what do you think, Crusaders? Were these cutie marks totally worth waiting for or what?
Sweetie Belle: Yeah! I can't wait to see who we're gonna help next!

[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
We started out just three
Crusaders driven to see
What we find in our hearts
Discover our destiny

And here we are, best friends
About to start it again
An adventure that never will end

We'll make our mark
Helping fillies most in need
We'll make our mark
So each one of them succeeds
'Cause the ultimate reward is a cutie mark!
